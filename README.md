# Sannikov Land

Sannikov Land was a phantom island in the Arctic Ocean. Its existence was conjectured by Yakov Sannikov, a Russian merchant and explorer, during his 1811 expedition. Sannikov reported seeing a vast land beyond the northern horizon while exploring the New Siberian Islands. This supposed land, named after him, spurred significant interest and led to numerous expeditions in the 19th century aimed at finding it. However, repeated searches yielded no evidence of its existence. The enduring mystery and allure of Sannikov Land contributed to its inclusion in Russian folklore and literature, notably in Vladimir Obruchev's 1926 science fiction novel "Sannikov Land." By the mid-20th century, scientific understanding and exploration of the Arctic had advanced sufficiently to confirm that Sannikov Land did not exist, and it was relegated to the category of mythical or phantom islands.
